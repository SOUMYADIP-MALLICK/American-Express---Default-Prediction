# American Express - Default Prediction

Whether out at a restaurant or buying tickets to a concert, modern life counts on the convenience of a credit card to make daily purchases.

That’s a complex problem with many existing solutions—and even more potential improvements, to be explored in this competition.

Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. Current models exist to help manage risk.
